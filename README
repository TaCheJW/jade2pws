CONCEPT

This project is an interface between JADE and PowerWorld Simulator through Matlab. It enables interfacing JADE agents with the power systems simulator PowerWorld.


REQUIREMENTS


To use jJadePowerWorld, you need:
- Matlab (tested only with R2011b), with the Instrument Control Toolbox. This toolbox is only used for the TCP functions. If you find another way to use TCP communication with Matlab, you may not need this toolbox.
- PowerWorld Simulator (tested with version 15), with the SimAuto option that enables COM communication with external programs. 


SETUP

I assume you already have Matlab and PowerWorld installed.

1. Get the jJadePowerWorld files.
2. Import them to your favorite IDE, like Eclipse.
3. Get JADE jar libraries (see link below).
4. Include the libraries to the jJadePowerWorld project.
5. Edit the powerWorldFilePath variables in the MatlabComAgent class, to point to the folder where your file is.
6. Run the JADE program with the Launcher class.
7. In Matlab, open the main.m file and run it.
8. The communication should then be established and several requests should be sent to PowerWorld from JADE. You should see things displaying in the console. If not, you have problem somewhere.


FILES

- In JADE
Launcher.java: A simple class that runs the two test agents.
MatlabComAGent.java: An agent that acts as a server and forwards information between JADE and Matlab.
MatlabComAGentTest.java: An agent that requests the previous agent to send some requests to PowerWorld.

- In Matlab:
main.m: This is the main file, that establishes the TCP connection and handles messages.
list_all_devices_in_file.m: This file can be used to list the devices, etc. in a PowerWorld file, directly from Matlab. It is easier to use than through JADE, but be careful about how data is formatted.
The other files are just functions used by main.m for sending and retrieving data to/from PowerWorld.


USING jJadePowerWorld

These file are free to use. 
I JUST REQUIRE YOU TO LET ME KNOW IF YOU USE IT OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE ME IN PAPERS USING IT? OR CITING ONE OF MY PAPERS (see Google Scholar).
However, no extensive testing has been done, so use it at your own risk. If you find bugs, errors, etc., or want to contribute, please let me know.
